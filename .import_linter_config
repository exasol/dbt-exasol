# Import linting for dbt-exasol
# Note: Uses 'dbt' as root package since import-linter/grimp requires top-level modules
# and cannot handle nested namespace packages like 'dbt.adapters.exasol' directly.
#
# To enable meaningful import linting, specific contracts should be added here.
# See: https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/
